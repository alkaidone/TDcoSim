# Installation
The stable release of TDcoSim can be installed from PyPI. The version under development can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/tdcosim/TDcoSim). The commands to be executed in the Windows command line interface for both options are included below:

## Stable
    pip install tdcosim

## From GitHub
    git clone https://github.com/tdcosim/TDcoSim.git
    cd tdcosim/
    pip install -e .

***
***Note:*** [Git](https://git-scm.com/) needs to installed  (incase it is not already available) before TDcoSim can be installed.

***

## Dependencies:
The packages listed below must be installed separately:

### Required

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) version = 2.7.5 for PSS速E, version =  33.3.0, version >= 3.5 for PSS速E, version =  35.0.0
* Power system simulator: [PSS速E, version =  33.3.0 or PSS速E, version =  35.0.0](https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/energy/services/transmission-distribution-smart-grid/consulting-and-planning/pss-software/pss-e.html)
* Distribution system simulator: [OpenDSS, version >= 8.6.1.1](https://sourceforge.net/projects/electricdss/) 
* DER simulator: [Solar PV-DER simulation utility, version >= 0.5.1](https://github.com/sibyjackgrove/SolarPV-DER-simulation-utility)
* Python packages for basic functionalities: SciPy, Numpy, Matlplotlib, Pywin32, XlsxWriter, Psutil
* Python packages for visualization: Dash, Plotly

***
***Note:*** Either demo (limited to 50 buses) or full version of PSS/E can be used.  OpenDSS is an open source software and can be installed for free.

***
***
***Note:*** PSS/E 35.0.0  and above support will support both 32 and 64 bit versions of Python.
***

### Optional

* For using the high performance ODE solver [diffeqpy, version >= 1.1.0](https://github.com/SciML/diffeqpy)

  * Install tdcosim with the diffeqpy flag as shown below.
    ```
       pip install tdcosim[diffeqpy]
    ```
  * Download and install Julia interpreter: [Julia, version >= 1.5](https://julialang.org/downloads/)

  * Add Julia to system PATH environment variables as shown [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/) (Only for Windows OS).

***
***Note:*** If co-simulations involving more than 10 detailed DER models are needed to be run, it is recommended to select *diffeqpy* as the ODE solver.

***
***
***Note:*** All Python packages can be installed with *pip* (e.g. *pip install scipy*)
