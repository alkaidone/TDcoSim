# Installation
The stable release of TDcoSim can be installed from PyPI. The version under development can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/tdcosim/TDcoSim). The commands to be executed in the Windows command line interface for both options are included below:

You can install tdcosim by running the following command on command line.

```
pip install git+https://github.com/tdcosim/TDcoSim.git@master
```

In the event you do not have git installed on your machine, you can alternatively run the following from command line.

```
pip install https://github.com/tdcosim/TDcoSim/archive/master.zip
```

After installation open a new command prompt and run the following to set psse path,

```
tdcosim setconfig -p "path\to\psse_installation"  
```

If PSSE 35 is being used the following may be used:

```
tdcosim setconfig -p "C:\Program Files\PTI\PSSE35\35.0\PSSPY37" 
```
If PSSE 33 is being used the following may be used:

```
tdcosim setconfig -p "C:\Program Files (x86)\PTI\PSSE33\PSSBIN" 
```

***
***Note:*** [Git](https://git-scm.com/) needs to installed  (incase it is not already available) before TDcoSim can be installed.

## Dependencies:
The packages listed below must be installed separately:

### Required

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) version = 2.7.5 for PSS速E, version =  33.3.0, version >= 3.5 for PSS速E, version =  35.0.0
* Power system simulator: [PSS速E, version =  33.3.0 or PSS速E, version =  35.0.0](https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/energy/services/transmission-distribution-smart-grid/consulting-and-planning/pss-software/pss-e.html)
* Distribution system simulator: [OpenDSS, version >= 8.6.1.1](https://sourceforge.net/projects/electricdss/) 
* DER simulator: [Solar PV-DER simulation utility, version >= 0.5.1](https://github.com/sibyjackgrove/SolarPV-DER-simulation-utility)
* Python packages for basic functionalities: SciPy, Numpy, Matlplotlib, Pywin32, XlsxWriter, Psutil
* Python packages for visualization: Dash, Plotly

***
***Note:*** Either demo (limited to 50 buses) or full version of PSS/E can be used.  OpenDSS is an open source software and can be installed for free.

***
***
***Note:*** PSS/E 35.0.0  and above support will support both 32 and 64 bit versions of Python.
***

### Optional

* For using the high performance ODE solver [diffeqpy, version >= 1.1.0](https://github.com/SciML/diffeqpy)

  * Install tdcosim with the **diffeqpy** flag as shown below.
    ```
       pip install tdcosim[diffeqpy]
    ```
  * After installation open a new command prompt and run the script **install_julia_diffeqpy.py** [available in the repository](https://github.com/tdcosim/TDcoSim/blob/v2.0.0rc2_dev/install_julia_diffeqpy.py). It will install Julia (if not already installed), all the required libraries, and setup a Julia environment linked to the Python environment.
    ```
       python install_julia_diffeqpy.py
    ```
  * Download and install Julia interpreter: [Julia, version >= 1.5](https://julialang.org/downloads/) (Optional)

  * Add Julia to system PATH environment variables as shown [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/) (Only for Windows OS) (Optional)

***
***Note:*** If co-simulations involving more than 10 detailed DER models are needed to be run, it is recommended to select *diffeqpy* as the ODE solver.

***
***
***Note:*** All Python packages can be installed with *pip* (e.g. *pip install scipy*)
