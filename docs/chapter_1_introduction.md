# Chapter 1
## Introduction to the Tutorial

This tutorial is intended to introduce the user to the TDcoSim tool. The user will be guided through the creation and development of multiple test cases so as to gain familiarity with the basic features and functionalities of the tool. The tutorial is developed in a sequential manner in which each of the use case builds upon what has been completed in the previous test case.

TDcoSim can be installed and used as a normal Python module. Detailed installation instructions for can be found [**here**](installation.md). 

The TDcoSim tool can be used to perform static and dynamic co-simulation of transmission and distribution networks with PV-DER's. The following figure illustrates the various components that can simulated using the TDcoSim tool.
