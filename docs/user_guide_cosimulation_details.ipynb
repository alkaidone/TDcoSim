    "# What is T+D co-simulation?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "This section provides a brief overview of T+D co-simulation with PSSE and OpenDSS as implemented in TDcoSim. Further details and theory can be found in [A combined transmission and distribution system co-simulation framework for assessing the impact of Volt/VAR control on transmission system](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8274633) and [Load Model Parameter Estimation by Transmission-Distribution Co-Simulation.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8442939)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions in current software version\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It is assumed that all the distribution feeders connected to the transmission system load bus have the same characteristics. Hence only one distribution feeder is simulated in an OpenDSS instance. The power output from the single feeder is then multiplied with a scaling factor (K) so that we can match the rated load at the transmission bus and emulate the effect that K feeders connected to the bus.\n",
    "2. No sub-station or transormer is modelled to interface the T bus with the distribution feeder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## T&D interface\n",
    "The transmission system simulator (TSS) and distribution system simulator (DSS) are seperate programs with their own solution methods. TDcoSim is responsible for exchanging data and synchronizng their runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data exchange\n",
    "The TSS, PSSE uses positive sequence quantities while the DSS, OpenDSS uses phasor quantities. Hence it is necessary to convert one positive sequence to equivalent phasor quantity and vice-versa. After PSSE completes a solution, it outputs the sequence voltages at the T&D interface. Then (1) is applied to convert the sequence voltages at the boundary bus to phase voltages. Using the phase voltages at the boundary bus, the DSS completes a solution and outputs the phase current injection at the boundary bus, which are expressed in (2).\n"
