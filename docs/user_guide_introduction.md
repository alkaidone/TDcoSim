## Introduction

The TDcoSim tool can be used to perform static and dynamic co-simulation of transmission and distribution networks with PV-DER's. The following figure illustrates the various components that can simulated using the TDcoSim tool.

This guide is intended to introduce the user to the basic functionalities of the TDcoSim tool and allow them to get started with using the tool within a short amount of time. Multiple case studies, have also been included which can be used by the user as a starting point.

TDcoSim can be installed and used as a normal Python module. Detailed installation instructions for can be found [**here**](user_guide_installation.md).
