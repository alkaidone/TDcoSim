# Test of TDcoSim

## Dynamic Case Study with Single Distribution System with and without DER

In this test, the TDcosim tool is tested for three different scenarios:
1. With distribution system connected to Bus 1 of 118 bus system where the DER penetration level is 10% of distribution system load and the DERs connected in the distribution system TRIP instantaneously below UV2 voltage level.
2. With distribution system connected to Bus 1 of 118 bus system where the DER penetration level is 10% of distribution system load and the DERs connected in the distribution system Ride Through the fault causing voltage sag below UV2 voltage level.
3. With distribution system connected to Bus 1 of 118 bus system without any DERs on the distribution system.
