# Utilitiy to perform Co-Simulation of Transmission and Distribution systems

Description of T&D co-simulation.

![schematic of TDcoSim]()

## Basics
The dynamics of the DER are modelled using dynamic phasors. Detailed description of the concepts behind this utility can be found in the IEEE publication **Dynamic Modeling of Solar PV Systems for Distribution System Stability Analysis** and detailed list of equations can be found in the [Model specification document.](docs/PV_DER_model_specification_rev3.docx)

* API Documentation:

## Installation
You can install the module directly from github with following commands:
```
git clone
cd
pip install -e .
```
## Using the module
The module can be imported as a normal python module:
```
import tdcosim
```
The following features are available currently:
1. Co-simulation with trasmission system defined in PSSE and distribution system defined in OpenDSS.
2. 
### Example: T&D co-simulation with 118 bus IEEE system
The following steps are required:
1. First import the following classes:
```
from from procedure.procedure import Procedure
```
